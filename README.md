# K_Means_Clustering
For this project I will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.

It is very important to note, I actually have the labels for this data set, but I will NOT use them for the KMeans clustering algorithm, since that is an unsupervised learning algorithm. I will use the labels to try to get an idea of how well the algorithm performed.

# The Data
I will use a data frame with 777 observations on the following 18 variables.

- Private A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university
- Apps Number of applications received
- Accept Number of applications accepted
- Enroll Number of new students enrolled
- Top10perc Pct. new students from top 10% of H.S. class
- Top25perc Pct. new students from top 25% of H.S. class
- F.Undergrad Number of fulltime undergraduates
- P.Undergrad Number of parttime undergraduates
- Outstate Out-of-state tuition
- Room.Board Room and board costs
- Books Estimated book costs
- Personal Estimated personal spending
- PhD Pct. of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s
- Terminal Pct. of faculty with terminal degree
- S.F.Ratio Student/faculty ratio
- perc.alumni Pct. alumni who donate
- Expend Instructional expenditure per student
- Grad.Rate Graduation rate
